Problem Statement-
In this challenge, we work with string streams.
  
stringstream is a stream class to operate on strings. It implements input/output operations on memory (string) based streams. stringstream can be helpful in different 
type of parsing. The following operators/functions are commonly used here

> Operator >> Extracts formatted data.
> Operator << Inserts formatted data.
> Method str() Gets the contents of underlying string device object.
> Method str(string) Sets the contents of underlying string device object.
  
Its header file is sstream.
One common use of this class is to parse comma-separated integers from a string (e.g., "23,4,56").

                stringstream ss("23,4,56");
                char ch;
                int a, b, c;
                ss >> a >> ch >> b >> ch >> c;           // a = 23, b = 4, c = 56

Here ch is a storage area for the discarded commas.
If the >> operator returns a value, that is a true value for a conditional. Failure to return a value is false.
Given a string of comma delimited integers, return a vector of integers.

Function Description-
Complete the parseInts function in the editor below.
  
parseInts has the following parameters:
 > string str: a string of comma separated integers

Returns
 > vector<int>: a vector of the parsed integers.
Note You can learn to push elements onto a vector by solving the first problem in the STL chapter.

Input Format-
There is one line of n integers separated by commas.

Constraints-
The length of str is less than 8*10^5.

Sample Input-
23,4,56
   
Sample Output-
23
4
56

Solution-
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str;
    cin >> str;
    int n=str.size();
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        char j;
        if(str[i] != ',')
        {
            cout<<str[i];
        }
        else
        cout<< "\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
