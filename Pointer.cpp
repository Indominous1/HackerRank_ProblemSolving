Problem Statement-
A pointer in C++ is used to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a 
variable, but it does not have ownership.

In order to access the memory address of a variable, val, prepend it with & sign. For example, &val returns the memory address of val.

This memory address is assigned to a pointer and can be shared among functions. For example, int *p = &val assigns the memory address of val to pointer p.To access the
content of the memory pointed to, prepend the variable name with a *. For example, *p will return the value stored in val and any modification to it will be performed 
on val.

                            void increment(int *v) {
                                 (*v)++;
                            }

                            int main() {
                            int a;
                            scanf("%d", &a);
                            increment(&a);
                            printf("%d", a);
                            return 0;
                            }

Function Description-
Complete the update function in the editor below.

update has the following parameters:

int *a: an integer
int *b: an integer

Returns-
The function is declared with a void return type, so there is no value to return. Modify the values in memory so that a contains their sum and b contains their 
absoluted difference.
> a' = |a+b|
> b' = |a-b|
  
Input Format-
Input will contain two integers, a and b, separated by a newline.

Sample Input-
4
5
  
Sample Output-
9
1
  
Explanation-
a' = 4+5 = 9
b' = |4-5| = 1
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution-
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void update(int *a,int *b) {
      int sum,diff;
      sum=*a+*b;
      diff=*a-*b;
      cout<<sum<<endl;
      cout<<abs(diff)<<endl;
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    
    int *pa=&a,*pb=&b;
    update(pa,pb);
    return 0;
}
